# DIKW?
## DIKW Pyramid – _Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom_

The **DIKW Pyramid** is a **hierarchical model** in data science and analytics used to show how **raw data is transformed into meaningful insights and decision-making wisdom**.

### 🔽 1. **Data** (D)

- **Raw facts**, unprocessed and context-free.
    
- Examples: Numbers, text, logs, sensor readings.
    
- 📌 _"What happened?" (Hindsight)_
    

### 🔼 2. **Information** (I)

- **Processed data** that provides meaning.
    
- Data + context = Information.
    
- Example: “Sales rose 15% in Q1 compared to Q4.”
    
- 📌 _"Why did it happen?" (Insight)_
    

### 🔼 3. **Knowledge** (K)

- **Analyzed information** that leads to understanding.
    
- Built through experience, learning, and interpretation.
    
- Example: “Q1 increases usually follow holiday marketing campaigns.”
    
- 📌 _"How can we improve?"_
    

### 🔼 4. **Wisdom** (W)

- **Insightful application of knowledge**.
    
- Involves judgment, ethics, foresight, and strategic thinking.
    
- Example: “Launch early campaigns next year to maximize Q1.”
    
- 📌 _"What should we do next?" (Foresight)_

> 🧠 **Remember**: As we move **up the DIKW pyramid**, we add **context, meaning, and value**—from raw data to informed, wise decisions.

# Need For Knowledge Management?
Knowledge Management (KM) involves capturing, sharing, and applying organizational knowledge to improve performance and foster innovation.

- **Leverages Expertise**: Utilizes internal knowledge for better, faster decisions.
    
- **Retains Knowledge**: Prevents loss when employees leave; aids onboarding.
    
- **Fosters Innovation**: Encourages collaboration and idea-sharing.
    
- **Improves Efficiency**: Reduces redundancy and errors through shared practices.
    
- **Enhances Decision-Making**: Provides timely, relevant insights for strategic choices.

# Driving forces and Issues in KM?
### Driving Forces

- **Globalization**: Increased competition demands better knowledge use.
    
- **Technology**: Tools like AI enhance knowledge capture and sharing.
    
- **Workforce Mobility**: KM helps retain knowledge despite employee turnover.
    
- **Compliance & Risk**: KM supports documentation, governance, and audits.
    

###  Key Issues

- **Cultural Barriers**: Silos and lack of sharing culture.
    
- **Tech Integration**: Compatibility with existing systems.
    
- **Security**: Balancing openness with IP protection.
    
- **Valuation**: Measuring KM impact and ROI is challenging.
# SECI model?
**SECI** stands for **Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization** — a model explaining how tacit and explicit knowledge interact in a continuous spiral within organizations.

### 1. 🧠 Socialization (Tacit → Tacit)

- Sharing knowledge through direct experience.
    
- Examples: mentoring, on-the-job training, informal interactions.
    

### 2. ✍️ Externalization (Tacit → Explicit)

- Converting tacit insights into documented knowledge.
    
- Methods: storytelling, diagrams, models, written manuals.
    

### 3. 🔗 Combination (Explicit → Explicit)

- Merging different pieces of explicit knowledge.
    
- Tools: meetings, reports, databases, intranets.
    

### 4. 📥 Internalization (Explicit → Tacit)

- Learning and embedding explicit knowledge through practice.
    
- Examples: simulations, hands-on training, reading and applying.
    

> 🔁 **Key Idea**: Knowledge is created in a _spiral_—moving through these four modes repeatedly to build organizational intelligence.

# Sources of Knowledge and KM challenges?
## Sources of Knowledge

1. **Experience** – Tacit knowledge from personal practice and observation.
    
2. **Education & Training** – Structured, explicit knowledge via courses, manuals.
    
3. **R&D** – New knowledge from experiments and publications.
    
4. **Collaboration & Networking** – Sharing insights through interactions and communities.
    
5. **Information Systems** – Databases and repositories storing explicit knowledge.
    

---

## 🧠 Tacit vs Explicit Knowledge

### 🔒 Tacit Knowledge

- Personal, experience-based
    
- Hard to articulate or codify
    
- Learned through practice
    
- Example: A chef’s intuition or a developer’s problem-solving flow
    

### 📄 Explicit Knowledge

- Documented, structured
    
- Easy to share and transfer
    
- Stored in manuals, databases
    
- Example: Recipe book, user manual
    

---

## 🛠️ KM Challenges (Mainly with Tacit Knowledge)

1. **Articulation Difficulty** – Hard to convert into explicit form
    
2. **Context Dependence** – Rooted in personal, situational experience
    
3. **Personalization** – Varies between individuals
    
4. **Transfer Mechanisms** – Requires mentoring, social learning
    
5. **Retention Risk** – Lost when key individuals leave
    

> ✅ _Explicit knowledge is easier to manage; tacit knowledge requires trust, interaction, and experience-sharing._
