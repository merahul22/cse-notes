# Explain the three approaches for determining an appropriate finance mix for an organization. Which is the most suitable?
## Finance Mix Approaches

Organizations use different strategies to determine how to fund their assets and operations. The three main approaches are:

---

### 1. **Hedging/Matching Approach**

- Match **short-term needs** with **short-term funds**, and **long-term needs** with **long-term funds**.
    
- Example: Finance seasonal inventory with short-term loans.
    
- **Balance of cost and risk**.
    

---

### 2. **Conservative Approach**

- Use **long-term funds** for both long-term and short-term (current) needs.
    
- Short-term finance is only for **emergencies**.
    
- **Low risk**, **high liquidity**, but **higher cost**.
    

---

### 3. **Aggressive Approach**

- Use **short-term funds** even for part of **long-term needs**.
    
- **Lower cost**, **higher profitability**, but also **higher risk**.
    

---
 
>  The ideal mix depends on risk tolerance, financial condition, and market dynamics. A **balanced or hybrid approach** is often recommended.
