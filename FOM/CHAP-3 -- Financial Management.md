# Capital Budgeting 
## 1) Capital Budgeting ?
### **Basics of Capital Budgeting**

**Capital budgeting** is the process of planning and evaluating investments in long-term assets such as machinery, buildings, and projects. It helps organizations decide **whether to invest in a particular project or asset**, based on expected future returns.

---

## **Key Concepts in Capital Budgeting**

|**Concept**|**Explanation**|
|---|---|
|**Investment Decision**|Choosing the most beneficial project from available options|
|**Time Value of Money**|Future cash flows are discounted to present value to assess actual worth|
|**Cash Flows**|Focus is on future cash inflows and outflows from the investment|
|**Risk and Uncertainty**|Investment risks are assessed and incorporated into decision-making|
|**Long-Term Perspective**|Deals with decisions affecting the company over several years|

---

## **Capital Budgeting Process**

1. **Project Identification** – Find potential investment opportunities.
    
2. **Evaluation of Cash Flows** – Estimate costs and expected cash inflows.
    
3. **Application of Decision Criteria** – Use techniques like NPV, IRR, Payback Period.
    
4. **Selection of Project** – Choose the project that best meets financial goals.
    
5. **Implementation** – Allocate resources and start the project.
    
6. **Review and Monitoring** – Evaluate actual performance over time.
    

---

## **Common Techniques of Capital Budgeting**

|**Technique**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Net Present Value (NPV)**|Present value of future cash flows minus initial investment (best method)|
|**Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**|Discount rate that makes NPV = 0; higher IRR is preferable|
|**Payback Period**|Time it takes to recover initial investment|
|**Profitability Index (PI)**|Ratio of present value of inflows to outflows; >1 means profitable|

### **Importance of Capital Budgeting**

- Ensures optimal allocation of limited financial resources
    
- Minimizes risk in investment decisions

# Capital Structure?
**Capital structure** refers to the **mix of different sources of long-term finance** used by a company to fund its operations and growth. These typically include:

- **Equity Shareholders’ Funds** (common shares and retained earnings)
    
- **Preference Share Capital**
    
- **Long-Term Debts** (like debentures, bonds, and loans)
    

---

### **Objectives of Capital Structure Decision**

While deciding the capital structure, a **finance manager** must balance three key factors:

| **Factor**             | **Explanation**                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Control**         | Use financing sources (like debt) that do not dilute existing shareholders’ control over the company.                                  |
| **2. Risk**            | Avoid excessive debt that increases the company’s financial risk, such as inability to repay obligations during downturns.             |
| **3. Cost of Capital** | Choose a mix that results in the **lowest overall cost of capital** (e.g., debt is cheaper but riskier; equity is costlier but safer). |

> [!Error]
> It is usually **not possible** to satisfy all three factors fully at the same time. Hence, a **trade-off** is necessary.

---

### **Prime Objective: Maximize Company Value**

Despite the above constraints, the **ultimate goal** of choosing the capital structure is to:

> **Maximize the value of the company** (i.e., increase market value of equity or share price).

This is often referred to as finding the **optimal capital structure**—a balance that:

- Minimizes the overall **cost of capital**
    
- Maintains acceptable **risk levels**
    
- **Preserves control** for key stakeholders

# Cost Of Capital  +  NPV +IRR ?

**Cost of Capital** is the **minimum return expected** by capital providers—**equity shareholders, lenders, and debtholders**—as compensation for investing their funds in a business. This cost includes:

- **Interest (on loans/debts)**
    
- **Dividends (on equity/preference shares)**
    
- **Opportunity cost (for retained earnings)**
    

It is used to **discount future cash flows** when evaluating investment decisions and is also called:

- **Cut-off rate**
    
- **Hurdle rate**
    
- **Minimum required rate of return**
    

### 🔹 **Key Uses of Cost of Capital:**

1. **Investment Evaluation** – Used as the discount rate to assess project viability.
    
2. **Financing Decision** – Helps choose the most cost-effective funding source.
    
3. **Credit Policy Design** – Helps determine optimal credit terms using cost-benefit analysis.

### ✅ **Short Note on Net Present Value (NPV)**

**NPV** is the **difference between the present value of future cash inflows and the present value of outflows (costs)**. It shows the **net increase in wealth** from a project or investment.

NPV=Present Value of Inflows−Present Value of Costs

- If **NPV > 0** → Project is **profitable** (adds value).
    
- If **NPV < 0** → Project should be **rejected**.
    
- NPV is a key tool in **capital budgeting** and aligns with the goal of **maximizing shareholder wealth**.
    

---

### ✅ **Short Note on Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**

**IRR** is the **discount rate** at which the **NPV of all future cash flows becomes zero**.

- It represents the **expected annual rate of return** from a project.
    
- IRR is found by solving the NPV equation for the rate that makes:$$NPV=0$$
- If **IRR > Cost of Capital** → Project is acceptable.
    
- If **IRR < Cost of Capital** → Project should be rejected.
    

# Mutual Funds?
A **mutual fund** is an **investment vehicle** that pools money from multiple investors and invests it in a **diversified portfolio** of assets such as **stocks, bonds, and other securities**. Managed by a **professional fund manager**, the objective is to provide investors with returns that align with the fund’s strategy.

---

# How a firm decide gearing ratio ?
**Gearing ratios** help measure how much a company is relying on debt (borrowed money) versus equity (owner’s money) to fund its activities. It shows how much of a company’s operations are financed by lenders (creditors) rather than shareholders.
### **Why Gearing Matters?**

- It helps a company decide how much debt to take on without becoming too risky.
    
- It affects the **cost of capital**, the **risk** the company is exposed to, and the **shareholder value**.

- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**
    
    - **Formula**: $$DebtEquity=\frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{Equity}}$$​
        
    - **What It Shows**: The proportion of debt relative to equity. High ratio → high financial risk.
        
- **Debt Ratio**
    
    - **Formula**: $$\frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{Total Assets}}$$
        
    - **What It Shows**: The percentage of a company’s assets financed by debt. A higher ratio indicates higher reliance on debt.
        
- **Equity Ratio**
    
    - **Formula**:$$\frac{\text{Equity}}{\text{Total Assets}}$$
        
    - **What It Shows**: The percentage of assets financed by equity. A high equity ratio means lower financial risk.
        
- **Interest Coverage Ratio**
    
    - **Formula**: $$\frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest Payments}}$$​
        
    - **What It Shows**: How easily a company can pay its interest on debt. A higher ratio indicates better ability to cover interest payments.
