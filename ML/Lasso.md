## ✅ 1. **What happens to the coefficients as α increases in Lasso?**

- **As α increases from 0 to ∞**:
    
    - Coefficients are increasingly **shrunk toward zero**.
        
    - **Some coefficients become exactly zero**, meaning Lasso can completely eliminate features.
        
    - This is called **sparse solution** — only the most useful features remain.
        

---

## ✅ 2. **Are higher magnitude coefficients affected more in Lasso?**

- **Yes, but differently than Ridge**:
    
    - Lasso doesn't just shrink all coefficients proportionally.
        
    - It tends to **push small or less important coefficients all the way to zero**.
        
    - Large, important coefficients may shrink **less** or survive, while weak ones get **eliminated**.
        
    - So, it’s **not just size**, but also **importance** and **correlation with target** that determines shrinkage.

## ✅ 3. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Lasso**

|**As α increases**|**Bias** increases|**Variance** decreases|
|---|---|---|
|Lasso simplifies the model by removing features|Model makes more assumptions (↑ bias)|Model becomes more stable (↓ variance)|

- **Small α** → Low bias, high variance (more complex model)
    
- **Large α** → High bias, low variance (simpler, sparser model)
    

Just like Ridge, Lasso **trades off some accuracy for better generalization** — but it does so by **removing irrelevant features**.

## ✅ 4. **What happens to the Loss Function in Lasso?**

$$J(w)=RSS+α∑∣wj∣J(w)$$


- As **α increases**, the **L1 penalty (sum of absolute values)** becomes more important in the total loss.
    
- The model **prefers to drive small weights exactly to 0** to minimize the loss.
    
- The optimization becomes **non-differentiable at 0**, which is why some coefficients get fully eliminated.
    

---

## ✅ 5. **Why is it called Lasso?**

- The term **Lasso** was introduced by **Robert Tibshirani in 1996**.
    
- It stands for:  
    **Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator**
    
- "Lasso" is a great metaphor — like a cowboy's lasso:
    
    - It **catches and pulls** the important features closer (shrinkage),
        
    - While **dropping the irrelevant ones** by setting their coefficients to zero (feature selection).

## ✅ 6. **Simple explanation of Lasso (for beginners):**

> Lasso regression is like **tidying up your feature set**. It finds the most important variables and **throws away the rest** by setting their coefficients to zero.  
> It helps your model be **simpler, faster, and easier to understand** — especially when you have lots of features.



## ✅ 1. Lasso Regression from Scratch 

```python
import numpy as np

class MyLassoGD:
    def __init__(self, alpha=0.1, learning_rate=0.01, epochs=1000):
        # alpha: regularization strength
        # learning_rate: step size for gradient descent
        # epochs: number of iterations
        self.alpha = alpha
        self.lr = learning_rate
        self.epochs = epochs
        self.coef_ = None  # weight vector
        self.intercept_ = None  # bias term

    def fit(self, X, y):
        n_samples, n_features = X.shape

        # Initialize coefficients and intercept to zero
        self.coef_ = np.zeros(n_features)
        self.intercept_ = 0

        # Perform gradient descent
        for _ in range(self.epochs):
            # Linear prediction: ŷ = Xw + b
            y_pred = X @ self.coef_ + self.intercept_

            # Error vector
            error = y_pred - y

            # Gradient for weights with L1 regularization (subgradient for |w|)
            dw = (1/n_samples) * (X.T @ error) + self.alpha * np.sign(self.coef_)

            # Gradient for intercept (no regularization)
            db = (1/n_samples) * np.sum(error)

            # Update weights and intercept
            self.coef_ -= self.lr * dw
            self.intercept_ -= self.lr * db

    def predict(self, X):
        # Return prediction: ŷ = Xw + b
        return X @ self.coef_ + self.intercept_
```

## ✅ 2. Lasso Regression Using `scikit-learn` 

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create synthetic regression dataset with 100 samples and 5 features
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=5, noise=10, random_state=42)

# Create Lasso model with regularization strength alpha = 1.0
model = Lasso(alpha=1.0)

# Fit the model to data
model.fit(X, y)

# Print model parameters
print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)       # Bias term
print("Coefficients:", model.coef_)         # Weight vector

# Predict on training data
y_pred = model.predict(X)

# Plot actual vs predicted values
plt.scatter(y, y_pred)
plt.xlabel("Actual y")
plt.ylabel("Predicted y")
plt.title("Lasso Predictions")
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

# why lasso leads to sparsity ?

### 🧠 Intuition: Why Lasso = Sparse

Lasso uses **L1 regularization**, which adds this penalty to the loss function:
$$α∑∣wj∣$$

α∑∣wj∣\alpha \sum |w_j|

- This **punishes large coefficients** — just like Ridge (L2) does.
    
- But **unlike Ridge**, the **L1 penalty has sharp corners** at zero. These sharp points make it easier for the optimizer to **"stick" some coefficients at zero**.
    
- So the optimizer **prefers dropping some features entirely** (setting their weight to zero), especially if they’re weak or redundant.
    

---

### 📐 Geometric Explanation:

- Ridge penalty creates a **circular/elliptical constraint** → soft shrinkage, no zeros.
    
- Lasso penalty forms a **diamond-shaped constraint** with corners at the axes.
    
- These corners make it more likely the solution lies **on the axes**, i.e., some weights = 0.
    

#### Visual:

Imagine the contours of the cost function (ellipses) touching the **L1 constraint diamond** — they tend to hit the sharp edges ⇒ coefficients become 0.

---

### 📉 Mathematical View:

During optimization, Lasso solves:

$$min⁡w(RSS+α∑∣wj∣)$$


Because the absolute value function **|w|** is not differentiable at 0, the gradient becomes a **subgradient**, and the solution often lands **exactly at 0** for some coefficients.

---

### ✅ Summary:

> **Lasso leads to sparsity because the L1 penalty "pushes" small coefficients all the way to 0**, especially when features are weak or correlated — making it great for feature selection.
